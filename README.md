CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions + AWS
# 🚀 DevOps CI/CD Pipeline – 7-Day Challenge

Hi! I'm Tanikasri, and I'm currently completing the **NextWork 7-Day DevOps Challenge**.

## 🔧 Project Goal
Build a complete CI/CD pipeline that:
- Connects GitHub with AWS
- Stores dependencies in AWS CodeArtifact
- Packages app with AWS CodeBuild
- Deploys with AWS CodeDeploy

## 🗓️ Commitment
I will set aside 2 hours every day for a week to work on this DevOps challenge. I will keep myself accountable by logging my progress daily in this repo. My reward for completing this challenge will be a relaxing weekend break or a small treat of my choice.

## 📅 Daily Progress Logs
- Day 1: Setup repo and AWS connection ✅
